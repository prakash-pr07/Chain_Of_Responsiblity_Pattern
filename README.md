The Chain of Responsibility Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows multiple objects to handle a request without tightly coupling the sender to the receiver.
Each handler in the chain decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in line.
This promotes loose coupling and flexibility in assigning responsibilities.
